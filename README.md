# BlHeli-Multishot
BLheli-Multishot is port of blheli that adds support for the Multishot signal protocol.  The Multishot protocol uses a 5-25Âµs signal that allows refresh rates of up to 32 KHz, while maintaining 240 steps of resolution.

This Johnnyruz version includes the updated startup tones developed for BLHeli_S targets. These are adjustable through the Beep Strength parameter.

Setting anything other than this will just use the BLHeli_S Defaults
